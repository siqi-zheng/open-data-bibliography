# A Practical Guide to Communicate Open Data with Ethical Considerations: Annotated Bibliography

This annotated bibliography is a guide to explore various aspects of open data communication from theory to practice with ethical considerations. This annotated bibliography is not meant to be comprehensive but suggestive. All selected sources contain further readings and fruitful resources for different types of target audience. This bibliography contains two sources for the general audience: Open Knowledge Foundation (2022) presents a self-contained guide about the ethical issues of open data for all researchers and York University (2019) illustrates the concept of open data in an accessible way. For institutions, this bibliography includes a paper about the theory and history of open data services and communication (Shaw, 2015) and a typical website of sharing open data under certain ethical and legal regulations by the City of Toronto (2018). We also offer two technical sources (Research Data Management Services @ MIT Libraries, 2016; Wickham, 2014) about open data cleaning and storage. For each source, we present the key focuses and the limitations in two paragraphs.
